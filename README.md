# Neo4j Couchbase Connector

Welcome to the [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) - [Couchbase](http://couchbase.com/) Connector project.  It provides functionality to direct a stream of events from Neo4j to Couchbase and viceversa.

This project is part of the "LARUS Integration Framework for Neo4j".

Please be aware that this project is still under development and at this very first stage it will work only for testing.

## Sources of Inspiration

We'd like to thank the authors of:
* The [Neo4j - Mongo Connector](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j_doc_manager), for the ideas for mapping the two different data models;
* The [Couchbase - Kafka Connector](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/connectors/kafka-1.2/kafka-intro.html), where we took inspiration on how to implement the mutation event dispatcher.

## Thank you

* [Michael Nitschinger](https://twitter.com/daschl), COUCHBASE - Lead Developer of the Couchbase Java SDK
