# Neo4j Couchbase Connector - Spotify Example

This module contains an examples showing how to use the [Neo4j - Couchbase Connector](https://github.com/larusba/neo4j-couchbase-connector).

It loads Spotify data into Couchbase via [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). As soon as Spotify data are loaded into Couchbase the event listener sends newly created documents to Neo4j.

Please be aware that this project is still under development and at this very first stage it will work only for testing.
